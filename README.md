# clipzero #

a simple clipboard manager. install with the build script ```build.sh``` (need rust installed) and run with clipzero
This application is best run in the background

No config options yet, probably none coming unless requested, so if overriding cmd+0 is not cool with you,
please open an issue so I can make this overridable.

## Usage ##

run with ```clipzero```

- open the window with cmd+0
- cycle through clipboard history with 1-9.
- hit enter to copy selected command to clipboard, or esc to close the window
